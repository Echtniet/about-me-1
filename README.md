## About

This repo will be utilized to share my personal details that everyone ought to know as well as handy resources and tools for a aspiring web developer.

<br />

## Recommended Tools

1. The first thing you need in order to publish with GitHub Pages is, you may have guessed it, a GitHub repo. So create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repo on and make sure to initialize it with a README.

2. Next, refer to the awesome [Mastering Markdown Article](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to create a markdown you are proud of of. The last step is to go to

[GitHub](https://github.com/)

3. The final step is to publish your site. The easiest way to do so is to go into the repository settings and enable GitHub pages, which will generate a link to your very own GitHub Page with a default github.io domain. Just copy and paste the link on a new window on a browser of your choice. I suggest you use Google Chrome because of the awesome developer tools, which will come in handy on your journey to becoming a developer.

## Recommended Resources

1. [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) maintains an extensive documentation on web standards and will be (should be) your go to resource as you start on your web development journey with HTML, CSS, and JS.

2. If you haven't subscribed to [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) yet then I would highly recommend you do so. He offers a ton of lessons and tutorials on his channel - all for free. If you do want to take the next step, you can also purchase his more in-depth courses on Udemy.

3. If you like me - lack creativity and can never envision beautiful color palletes for your website - then you should utilize [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/) to obtain some beautiful color combinations and their hex codes.
